# Data Licences and Attribution

Calori's bundled food database (`assets/db/foods.sqlite`) is compiled from several
public food composition tables. This file records what each contributes, under what
terms, and the exact attribution each licence requires.

The in-app **Sources** screen renders the same information from the `meta` table of
the shipped database, so it always reflects what actually built — see
[03-food-data.md](03-food-data.md).

Retrieval dates are stamped by `tools/build_foods_db/manifest.py` at build time and
mirrored here whenever the database is rebuilt.

- **Paper:** *Current Developments in Nutrition* (2024), open access.
- **Licence:** **The repository carries no LICENSE file.** No explicit redistribution grant
  has been located. The open-access licence on the paper does not license the dataset, and
  the underlying IFCT data must be requested separately from ICMR-NIN.
- **Status:** Included by project decision, with attribution, pending written permission
  from the authors. The build adapter (`tools/build_foods_db/sources/indb.py`) is isolated
  so this source can be removed with one file change and a rebuild.

### Food Composition Table for Pakistan (revised 2001)

- **Publisher:** Government of Pakistan / UNICEF; hosted by FAO
- **URL:** https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/food_composition/documents/regional/Book_Food_Composition_Table_for_Pakistan_.pdf
- **Licence:** FAO-hosted publication. Terms to be confirmed before shipping this source.
- **Obligation:** Attribution. **⚠ Verify FAO's reuse terms before a public release build.**
  This source is now *included in the build* — 175 foods — so this is no longer
  a hypothetical. Every other source here is explicitly redistributable; this
  one is not yet established as such. Either confirm the terms or drop
  `PAKISTAN` from `SOURCES` in `tools/build_foods_db/build.py` and rebuild.
- **Source:** the published table is a scanned PDF with no text layer. The build
  reads a transcribed spreadsheet placed by hand at
  `tools/build_foods_db/.cache/pakistan_fct/pakistan_fct.xlsx`; the figures are
  the 2001 table's, the transcription is not FAO's.
- **Attribution used:**
  > Food Composition Table for Pakistan (revised 2001). Department of
  > Agricultural Chemistry and Human Nutrition, NWFP Agricultural University
  > Peshawar, with UNICEF Islamabad and the Ministry of Planning and
  > Development, Government of Pakistan.

## Deliberately excluded

These are excluded to keep `foods.sqlite` free of share-alike obligations, so the built
database can be reused without inheriting a copyleft licence.

| Source | Licence | Why excluded |
|---|---|---|
| Australian Food Composition Database (AFCD) | CC BY-SA 3.0 AU | **Share-alike** on derivative databases |
| Open Food Facts | ODbL 1.0 (contents: DbCL; images: CC BY-SA) | **Share-alike** on derivative databases |
| USDA Branded Foods | CC0 | 2.9 GB; manufacturer-submitted and inconsistent; only useful with a barcode scanner |
| `ifct2017` | AGPL-3.0 since April 2025 | AGPL is unsuitable for a distributed mobile app |

If a share-alike pack is shipped later (`foods_ext.sqlite`), it will be distributed
separately under ODbL with its own notice, and will not be merged into `foods.sqlite`.

## Energy unit note

IFCT 2017 reports energy in **kJ**; IFCT 2004 reported kcal. The builder converts with
the FAO factor **kcal = kJ / 4.184** and fails the build on any row exceeding 900 kcal per
100 g, which is the signature of an unconverted kJ value.
