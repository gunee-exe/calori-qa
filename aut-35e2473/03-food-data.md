# Food Data — Sources, Pipeline, Schema

> The bundled food database. Built once on desktop by a Python script, shipped as a read-only
> SQLite asset. This is Phase 0 of [02-phases.md](02-phases.md), expanded.

**Goal:** genuinely global coverage — not a desi-only or USDA-only subset — in an asset of a few
megabytes. USDA alone is broad but American-shaped and thin on prepared dishes from elsewhere.
The answer is a **multi-source merge with strict provenance**.

## 1. Licence landscape

This table drives the architecture. Read it before touching a downloader.

| Source | Records | Licence | Redistribute in a public app | Share-alike |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| USDA FDC — SR Legacy | 7,793 | Public domain / CC0 | Yes | No |
| USDA FDC — Foundation | ~470 | Public domain / CC0 | Yes | No |
| USDA FDC — FNDDS / Survey | 5,432 | Public domain / CC0 | Yes | No |
| **CoFID** (UK, OHID) | ~2,900 | **Open Government Licence v3** | Yes, attribution | No |
| **CIQUAL** (FR, ANSES) | ~3,200 | **Licence Ouverte / Etalab** | Yes, attribution | No |
| **CNF** (Canada, Health Canada) | ~5,690 | **OGL–Canada** | Yes, attribution | No |
| **Frida** (DK, DTU) | ~1,300 | Free, mandatory credit; no formal licence | Yes, attribution | Unclear |
| **INDB** (India) | 1,095 items + 1,014 recipes | **No LICENSE file** | Accepted risk — see §7 | — |
| **Pakistan FCT** (rev. 2001) | 210 | FAO-hosted, PDF only | Extraction required | Verify |
| AFCD (Australia, FSANZ) | 1,588 | **CC BY-SA 3.0 AU** | Yes | **YES** |
| Open Food Facts | ~3.7M | **ODbL 1.0** (+ DbCL contents) | Yes | **YES** |
| USDA Branded | ~1.9M | CC0 | Yes, but 2.9 GB | No |

### The share-alike split

AFCD (CC BY-SA) and Open Food Facts (ODbL) both impose share-alike on *derivative databases*.
Merging either into `foods.sqlite` arguably makes the whole merged artefact share-alike — which
on a public repo is survivable, but it contaminates every downstream reuse of the build. So keep
them physically separate:

- **`foods.sqlite`** — the permissive core. Ships in the APK. No share-alike encumbrance.
- **`foods_ext.sqlite`** — a later share-alike pack (AFCD + an Open Food Facts slice for packaged
  goods), distributed under ODbL as an optional download.

v1 ships the core only, matching the concept doc's "Open Food Facts — not in v1". Design the
two-file split in from the start so the pack drops in later with no schema change.

USDA Branded is excluded on separate grounds: 2.9 GB, manufacturer-submitted and inconsistent,
and it only pays off with a barcode scanner, which is out of scope.

## 2. v1 composition

### Shipped today: 17,794 foods, 35,698 portions, 4.2 MB

| Source | Contributed | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| USDA SR Legacy | 6,313 | generic ingredients and single foods |
| USDA FNDDS | 5,272 | prepared and mixed dishes; richest portion data |
| CoFID (UK) | 2,608 | British and Commonwealth dishes USDA has no entry for |
| CIQUAL (FR) | 2,291 | French-language coverage |
| INDB (India) | 1,014 | Indian recipes **with household portions** |
| USDA Foundation | 296 | newest lab analysis; outranks SR Legacy on overlap |

19,768 raw rows in, 1,974 exact-name duplicates collapsed. Zero quarantined,
287 warnings (kept and reported to `out/warnings.csv`).

INDB is the most valuable row-for-row. USDA knows what "rice, white, cooked"
is; it does not know what a plate of chicken biryani weighs. INDB gives both,
in the units people use — "1 bowl", "1 plate", "1 roti". It publishes a
serving's *nutrients* rather than its weight, so the adapter derives the weight
from the energy ratio, which is exact because both figures come from the same
underlying quantity:

    grams = 100 x serving_kcal / kcal_100g

That yields 36 g for a chapati, 25 g for an idli, 208 g for a plate of biryani.

> **The download page overstates FNDDS by 60x.** It lists the survey CSV at
> 200 MB zipped / 1.6 GB unzipped; the actual archive is **3.2 MB**. The whole
> build downloads under 20 MB.

> **FNDDS uses a different nutrient numbering scheme.** SR Legacy and Foundation
> reference FoodData Central ids (1008 for energy); FNDDS references the legacy
> SR `nutrient_nbr` values (208) — in a column named `nutrient_id`. This does
> not error, it silently parses to *zero records*. The adapter resolves roles
> from each archive's own `nutrient.csv` rather than hardcoding either scheme.

> **Two national tables put kcal and kJ in adjacent columns with near-identical
> headings.** CIQUAL's energy heading appears twice; CoFID's "Energy (kcal)"
> sits immediately before "Energy (kJ)". Both adapters exclude the kJ heading
> explicitly. Matching the first hit would import a 4.184x error wholesale.

### Still to add

**CNF (Canada)** — adapter written and registered; the archive must be fetched
by hand. `canada.ca` would not serve it to this build (the direct link times
out, the open.canada.ca mirror returns a redirect page). Save the CSV zip as
`tools/build_foods_db/.cache/cnf/cnf.zip` and re-run — the build then picks it
up unattended and reports the same instructions until you do.

CNF is worth the manual step: about 5,690 foods, and its CONVERSION FACTOR
table maps each food to named household measures, which most national tables do
not publish at all. Its nutrient values use the legacy SR numbering, the same
scheme FNDDS uses.

**Frida (Denmark)** — not written. The site has moved: `frida.fooddata.dk` now
redirects to `fcdb.fooddata.dk`, which does not resolve from this machine, so
the file's actual shape is unknown. A parser written against a guessed layout
would look finished and silently produce nothing, which is worse than an empty
slot; it needs someone who can reach the site to look at one file first.

**Pakistan FCT** — PDF only, so it needs extraction before an adapter is worth
writing. 210 foods, and the most valuable ones for this app's audience after
INDB — karahi and haleem currently return nothing.

Each is one file in `tools/build_foods_db/sources/` plus one line in
`build.py`, so the merge ships with whatever is ready.

---

## 3. Schema

This **extends** the `foods` table in [01-concept.md](01-concept.md). That version gives each
food a single `serving_desc` / `serving_grams`, which is too narrow: FNDDS, CNF and CoFID all
supply **multiple** household portions per food, and both UC-05 and the prototype's unit chips
need them. Portions are promoted to a child table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foods (
  id              INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  name            TEXT NOT NULL,
  name_normalised TEXT NOT NULL,
  source          TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'usda_sr'|'usda_fndds'|'cofid'|'ciqual'|'indb'|...
  source_id       TEXT,            -- original key, for traceability back to the CSV
  locale_hint     TEXT,            -- 'IN','PK','GB','FR','US' — a ranking bias, never a filter
  kcal_100g       REAL NOT NULL,
  protein_100g    REAL NOT NULL,
  carbs_100g      REAL NOT NULL,
  fat_100g        REAL NOT NULL
) STRICT;

CREATE TABLE food_portions (
  id         INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  food_id    INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES foods(id),
  label      TEXT NOT NULL,        -- '1 plate', '1 medium', '1 cup'
  grams      REAL NOT NULL,
  is_default INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
) STRICT;

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE foods_fts USING fts5(
  name, content=foods, content_rowid=id,
  tokenize="unicode61 remove_diacritics 2"
);

-- `key` is reserved in drift's SQL parser, hence `name`.
CREATE TABLE meta (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT) STRICT;
-- build_version, built_at, and a per-source manifest of licence + attribution string
```

Notes:

- **`remove_diacritics 2`** matters once CIQUAL and Frida are in — it makes *crème* findable by
  typing `creme`.
- **`content=foods`** (external content) stops FTS5 duplicating every name string, roughly
  halving the index.
- The **`meta` manifest** is what the in-app Sources screen reads, so that screen can never drift
  from what actually shipped.
- Because the asset is built offline and never written on device, **no FTS5 sync triggers are
  needed** — the builder populates `foods_fts` directly and ships the finished index.

## 4. Pipeline

```
tools/build_foods_db/
  build.py                orchestrator
  sources/base.py         Source protocol -> yields FoodRecord
  sources/usda_sr.py  usda_foundation.py  usda_fndds.py
  sources/cofid.py  ciqual.py  cnf.py  frida.py  indb.py  pakistan_fct.py
  normalise.py  dedup.py  validate.py  writer.py  manifest.py
```

One adapter per dataset, each yielding a common `FoodRecord`. Adding or dropping a source is one
file plus one manifest line — this is what makes any single dataset cheap to remove.

### Normalisation

fold accents → lowercase → drop punctuation → collapse whitespace. Trailing USDA preparation
qualifiers (`, raw`, `, cooked, boiled, drained, without salt`) are split into a separate `prep`
note rather than kept in the search name or discarded.

**No singularisation.** It was implemented and removed: every rule short enough to be worth
having turns "molasses" into "molasse" and "couscous" into "couscou", and the exception list
required to avoid that would have to be mirrored exactly in Dart.

**The Python and Dart normalisers must agree byte for byte.** Python writes
`foods.name_normalised`; Dart (`lib/core/food_name.dart`) computes the value compared against it,
both for the search prefix tier and for `food_cache` lookups. A divergence throws nothing — the
cache simply never hits. Two traps found while pairing them:

- Python's `\w` excludes Indic combining marks, so `बिरयानी` normalised to `ब रय न`. Both sides
  now keep `\p{M}`.
- `ø`, `đ`, `ł`, `ħ`, `ı`, `ŧ`, `ß`, `æ`, `œ`, `ð`, `þ` have no NFKD decomposition. Folding `ø` to
  `o` in Dart alone would have stored *Smørrebrød* as `smorrebrod` and made it unfindable.

`tools/build_foods_db/gen_golden_test.py` generates `test/core/food_name_test.dart` from the
Python implementation. Rerun it whenever `normalise.py` changes.

### Dedup and precedence

Match on **exact normalised name only** for automatic merging. Compute token-set overlap
(Jaccard ≥ 0.85) as a *review signal* written to a CSV — **never auto-merge on a fuzzy match.**

The concept doc's argument against fuzzy-matching photos applies verbatim here: a bad match that
*succeeds silently* is worse than a miss, because it produces confident wrong numbers wearing an
authoritative source label.

Precedence on collision:

1. **Regional specificity** — INDB / Pakistan FCT for desi dishes, CoFID for UK dishes. A
   regional table's "biryani" beats USDA's.
2. **FNDDS** for prepared and mixed dishes.
3. **USDA Foundation** (newest lab data), then **SR Legacy**, for generics.
4. **CoFID → CIQUAL → CNF → Frida** for whatever is still net-new.

Sources late in that order contribute only rows nobody else has — which is why CNF's 5,690 rows
add a few hundred net-new entries rather than 5,690 duplicates, and why the merged total lands
near 19,000 rather than 29,000.

### Validation

**IFCT 2017 reports energy in kJ** (IFCT 2004 used kcal). Convert with **kcal = kJ / 4.184** —
the FAO factor, not the rounded 4.2; across a day's logging that difference is visible.

Build-time assertions that fail the build loudly:

- `0 ≤ kcal_100g ≤ 900` — 900 ≈ pure fat, so anything above is a kJ value that escaped conversion
- each macro `0 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `protein + carbs + fat ≤ 100` per 100 g
- **Atwater cross-check**: `4·protein + 4·carbs + 9·fat` against the stated kcal, tolerance
  **±25 %** — deliberately wide, because fibre, alcohol, polyols and food-specific Atwater
  factors all shift it legitimately. Outside tolerance → quarantine CSV for a human pass, never
  a silent drop.
- every food has ≥ 1 portion, `grams > 0`
- no duplicate `(source, source_id)`; `count(foods_fts) == count(foods)`

Finish with `PRAGMA page_size=4096;` and `VACUUM;`.

**Done when:** CLI queries for `roti`, `biryani`, `chicken breast`, `daal`, `pizza` and
`crème brûlée` all return sane ranked results with plausible macros, and a hand-check of a few
rows against the source CSVs agrees.

---

## 5. App-side implementation

- **Search:** 250 ms debounce → `buildFtsQuery` → `searchFoods` → results.
- **Ranking:** a prefix tier, then `bm25()`, then name length.

  bm25 alone is a poor fit for short food names — it rewards term frequency relative to document
  length, so "rice" returned *"Snacks, rice cakes, brown rice, buckwheat"* (which says "rice"
  twice) above actual rice, and "pizza" returned "Pizza rolls". Preferring names that *begin* with
  what was typed fixes both and matches what someone typing into a search box expects.

  Within a tier, `bm25()` returns **negative** scores where more negative is better, so
  **ascending is correct** — it reads wrong and is right. Name length breaks the final tie toward
  the shorter, more generic entry.
- **Result card:** the source badge (`INDB` / `USDA` / `CoFID`) is already in the prototype and
  is now backed by real provenance. Portion chips come from `food_portions` with `is_default`
  first; grams stay visible as the secondary readout, matching "serving units primary, grams
  secondary" from UC-05.
- **Sources screen** reads the `meta` manifest, so it lists exactly what shipped in this build.
- Bump `kFoodsAssetVersion` on every rebuild; the filename-versioned asset copy handles the swap.

### FTS5 query escaping

FTS5 has its own grammar (`AND OR NOT NEAR`, `*`, `^`, `:`, `"`, parens). Raw user input is both
a syntax-error generator and a DoS vector. **Tokenise and quote — never blocklist characters.**

```dart
/// 'chick-pea "curry' -> '"chick" "pea" "curry"*'
String buildFtsQuery(String input) {
  final t = input.split(RegExp(r'[^\p{L}\p{N}]+', unicode: true))
                 .where((s) => s.isNotEmpty).toList();
  if (t.isEmpty) return '';
  return [
    for (var i = 0; i < t.length; i++)
      i == t.length - 1
          ? '"${t[i].replaceAll('"', '""')}"*'   // * OUTSIDE the quote
          : '"${t[i].replaceAll('"', '""')}"',
  ].join(' ');
}
```

Three things this gets right:

- **The `*` sits outside the closing quote.** `"chicken"*` is a prefix query; `"chicken*"` is a
  phrase containing a literal asterisk, which the tokeniser strips, silently degrading to an
  exact-token match. This is the most common FTS5 bug.
- **Splitting on `[^\p{L}\p{N}]+`** removes every operator structurally, so none can reach the
  parser.
- **Prefix on the last token only** — otherwise every keystroke scans a huge prefix range.

Guard `if (q.isEmpty) return [];` before querying — an empty `MATCH` is a runtime error, not an
empty result.

---

## 6. Attribution

The repo is public, so this is an obligation, not a courtesy.

- **`DATA-LICENSES.md`** at the repo root: per-source licence, URL, retrieval date, and the exact
  attribution string each licence demands. Written during Phase 0, not deferred to Phase 7.
- **In-app Sources screen in v1**, driven by the `meta` manifest.
- OGL v3, Licence Ouverte and OGL–Canada all permit commercial use but **require attribution** —
  discharged by the above.
- **AFCD and Open Food Facts stay out of `foods.sqlite`** so share-alike never contaminates the
  merged core.

---

## 7. INDB — recorded decision

The INDB GitHub repo has **no LICENSE file**, which under GitHub's terms defaults to
all-rights-reserved. Its underlying ICMR-NIN IFCT 2017 data must be requested separately from
NIN. [01-concept.md](01-concept.md) describes INDB as CC BY; that is not verified and appears to
be wrong — the open-access licence on the *paper* does not license the *dataset*.

**Decision: use it anyway.** Mitigations:

- Attribute the paper and the repo prominently in `DATA-LICENSES.md` and the Sources screen.
- Email the authors for written permission in parallel with the build; academics usually grant
  this within days.
- Keep `sources/indb.py` swappable, so removing it is one file plus one manifest line and a
  rebuild.

The alternative — `github.com/ifct2017/ifct2017` — relicensed to **AGPL-3.0 in April 2025**,
which is a worse trap in a distributed mobile app. Noted here so the option isn't rediscovered
and mistaken for an easy fix.
