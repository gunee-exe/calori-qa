"""Plausibility checks run over every record before it is written.

The point of this file is to make bad data loud. A silently wrong calorie
figure in a bundled database is worse than a missing food: the user cannot tell
it is wrong, and the app shows it with a source badge that says it is
authoritative.

But an over-eager validator is its own failure. The first version of this file
rejected lard, vodka and whole turkeys, and would have shipped a food database
with no cooking fats in it. So the checks are split three ways:

  * **repair** — defects with an unambiguous correct value, fixed silently.
  * **reject** — the record cannot be true, so it is quarantined for review.
  * **warn**   — surprising but legitimately possible; the record ships and the
                 warning is reported.

The defect that actually matters is a kilojoule value imported as kilocalories.
IFCT 2017 reports energy in kJ throughout, and several European tables carry
both columns. Reading kJ as kcal inflates a food 4.184x, which lands far above
the ceiling below.

#: Pure fat is 900 kcal/100g by Atwater, and USDA reports 902 for oils, lard
#: and tallow. The ceiling sits just above that: high enough to keep every
#: cooking fat, low enough that a kJ value read as kcal — 4.184x too large, so
#: 1,600+ for anything calorie-dense — is still caught with enormous margin.
MAX_KCAL_100G = 920.0

#: USDA computes carbohydrate "by difference": 100 minus water, protein, fat
#: and ash, each measured independently. For meat and fish, where carbohydrate
#: is genuinely zero, accumulated rounding pushes the result slightly below it.
#: Chicken breast, pork chop, lamb and tuna all land near -0.5 g/100g.
#:
#: A small negative is clamped to zero rather than rejected. Anything more
#: negative is not rounding noise, it is a parse error, and still fails.
CARB_ROUNDING_SLACK = -1.0

#: Ceiling for a single macro, and for the three together.
#:
#: Not 100. CoFID — and several other national tables — express carbohydrate as
#: **monosaccharide equivalents**: sucrose gains water when it hydrolyses, so
#: 100 g of sugar is reported as about 105 g of carbohydrate. That is a
#: convention, not an error, and a 100 g ceiling silently deletes brown sugar,
#: peppermints, meringue and boiled sweets from the database.
#:
#: 110 leaves room for the convention while still catching a column that has
#: been read in the wrong units.
MAX_MACRO_100G = 110.0

#: is a unit error rather than a portion.
