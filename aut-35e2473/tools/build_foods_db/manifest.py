"""Builds the `meta` table contents.

This is what the in-app Sources screen reads. Deriving it from the sources that
actually ran — rather than from a hand-maintained list — is the point: the
screen then cannot claim a dataset the build did not include, or omit one it
did. That matters because several of these licences require attribution, and an
attribution screen that has drifted from the shipped data is worse than none.
